	<h1>Jorge's Biography</h1>

	<p>I was born and raised in Quito, Ecuador, on May 21st 1998. My family, of four, is very close: My parents, Jorge and Glenda, and my older sister, Genoveva.When I turned 5, I entered the school where I spent the following 12 years, until graduation. Those years would not have been the same without my dearest friends, classmates, and professors.</p>

	<p>Now, I am an undergraduate student at Tufts Univeristy, passionate about software engineering and self-driven to improve the access to educational resources in developing regions, specifically Latin America. I hope to one day acquire the skills and obtain the platforms that are necessary to make impactful improvements in the lives of curious, imaginative, low-income students.</p>
