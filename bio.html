	<h1>Biography</h1>

	<p>I was born on the summer of '98 in Quito, Ecuador, and raised on the same city, surrounded by the beautiful Andes landscape. My family, of four, is very close: My parents, Jorge and Glenda, and my older sister, Genoveva. When I turned 5, I entered the school where I spent the following 12 years, until graduation. Those years would not have been the same without my dearest friends, classmates, and professors.</p>

	<p>Currently, I am an undergraduate student at Tufts Univeristy double majoring in Computer Science and Quantitative Economics. I have found my passion in software engineering and am now self-driven to employ it in improving the access to educational resources in developing regions, specifically Latin America. For now, I try to gain exposure to different CS areas, both academically and in industry, hoping to soon discover my niche. Eventually, I want to build my own organization with the purpose of providing the platforms necessary to make impactful improvements in the lives of curious and imaginative low-income students.</p>
