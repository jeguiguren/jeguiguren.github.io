Assignment 1: Personal Website
COMP 20
Feb. 4, 2018

1. Overall, the HTML pages have been correctly implemented and validated.
The CSS files, however, were not validated because the jigsaw validation page
did not load (as of Feb. 4, 2018).
The general overview of the website looks good, both in functionality 
and appearance. 

2. I would like to thank my friend Joaquin Bustamante for showing
me how the HTML "class" attribute works.

3. I spent approximately 5 hours completing this assignment.
